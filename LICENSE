Injectionmap_v2 General License ( Public )

Version 1.0, 

2017 - 2024 - byt3n33dl3 (Sulaiman) - SQLmapProject

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the Injectionmap_v2 General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free softwareâ€”to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. You can apply it to your programs, too. Terms and Conditions for Copying, Distribution, and Modification

0. Definitions

"This License" refers to version 1 of the Injectionmap_v2 General Public License.
"The Program" refers to any software licensed under this License.
"You" refers to the licensee, or person using the Program.
"Distribution" and "Modifying" include copying, merging, publishing, distributing, sublicensing, and/or selling copies of the Program.
1. Grant of License

You are granted permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute the Program, under the following conditions:

You must conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. Modifications

You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

The modified work must carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
The modified work must carry a notice that it is released under this License and any conditions added in accordance with Section 7.

3. Distribution of Modified Works

You may distribute modified works under the terms of Section 1, provided that you include the source code of the modified work, or a written offer to provide the source code. The modified work must be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
4. No Endorsement

Nothing in this License grants permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for describing the origin of the Program.
5. Disclaimer of Warranty

The Program is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Program is with you. Should the Program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.
6. Limitation of Liability

In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who may modify and/or redistribute the Program as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the Program (including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the Program to operate with any other programs), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

This license provides similar freedoms and protections as the GPL, but is specifically named and tailored for "Injectionmap_v2," addressing its expanded functionality beyond SQL injections to include various types of injection vulnerabilities. If you have any specific modifications or additions you'd like to make, let me know!
